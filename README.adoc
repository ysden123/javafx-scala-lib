== Modules
The project consists of following modules:

* app
* buildSrc
* lib

_app_ module - is the implementation of *UI*.

_lib_ module - is the library. It contains the services. The services are written on *Scala* and on *Java*. The _lib_ module has not module-info definition.

_buildSrc_ module - is the Gradle project specific settings.

The _kotlin_ directory contains usual Gradle settings.

The _java_ directory contains code of the extra module-info plugin.
This plugin is used in the _build.gradle.kts_ for _app_ module (see "_extra-java-module-info_").
